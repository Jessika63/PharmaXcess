# PharmaXcess Distributeur

## Description

These dispensers will serve two purposes. Once connected to the medication distribution system, they can dispense medication with or without a prescription:

- Without a prescription: Customers can select the desired medications and purchase them directly.
- With a prescription: Customers can scan their prescription, health insurance card, and ID card. The prescription will be processed, and the listed medications will be dispensed.
