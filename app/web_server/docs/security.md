# Medical Application Backend – Security Overview

This backend system is designed to manage sensitive medical data while adhering to high security and privacy standards, including GDPR compliance. Below is an overview of the main security measures implemented.

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** are used for secure, stateless authentication.
- All APIs are protected with **role-based access control**, ensuring that only authorized users (e.g., doctors, patients, admins) can access specific resources.
- Passwords are never stored in plain text and are **hashed using the BCrypt algorithm**.

## 🔒 Secure Communication

- All client-server communication is enforced over **HTTPS** using TLS 1.2 or above.
- **CORS** is enabled with strict origin rules to limit access to trusted frontend clients.

## 🧑‍⚕️ GDPR Compliance

- The backend follows key principles of the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**, including:
  - **Data minimization**: only essential user data is stored.
  - **Right to be forgotten**: users can request the permanent deletion of their data.
  - **Data portability**: structured data export features are in development.
  - **Explicit consent** is required for storing any medical or personally identifiable information (PII).

## 🔐 Data Protection

- Sensitive data (e.g., medical records, patient identifiers) is **encrypted at rest** using industry-standard encryption (e.g., AES-256).
- **Environment-specific secrets** (e.g., encryption keys, JWT secrets) are never hardcoded and are securely managed.

## 🛡️ Security Logging & Monitoring

- All authentication attempts and security-related events are **logged securely**.
- Logs are anonymized to avoid storing sensitive data.
- Logs are periodically reviewed to detect suspicious or unauthorized activity.

## 🧰 Additional Measures

- Input validation and sanitization are implemented to prevent **SQL injection**, **XSS**, and other common attacks.
- **Dependency security checks** are regularly performed to detect known vulnerabilities.
- The application is developed with **secure coding practices** and subject to regular security audits.
