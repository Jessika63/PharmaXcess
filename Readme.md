## Presentation

Our idea is to create a dispenser integrated into the pharmacy storefront (similar to ATMs at banks) along with a complementary app.

These dispensers will serve two purposes. Once connected to the medication distribution system, they can dispense medication with or without a prescription:

- Without a prescription: Customers can select the desired medications and purchase them directly.
- With a prescription: Customers can scan their prescription, health insurance card, and ID card. The prescription will be processed, and the listed medications will be dispensed.

The application will provide several features, including:

- Locating nearby dispensers
- Ordering medication via click-and-collect
- Validating prescriptions
- Tracking treatments
- Receiving alerts for medication schedules
- And maintaining a patient health record
